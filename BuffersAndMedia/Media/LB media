LB medium and LB agar-plates


Method for both:

Rinse out a clean bottle with
dH2O then ~1/2 fill with dH2O 
Measure out appropriate weight
of each component for the volume required â€“ best to add yeast extract last to
avoid contamination of other media (tryptone & NaCl)
Shake to mix and add dH2O to
desired final volume
Autoclave with lids loose
