'## Considerations when setting up a qPCR assay ##

Just a few things that others have mentioned etc and are useful to consider before starting qPCR work

1) Choice of mastermix

Some work better for different sample types. For example Takyon seems so work well with soil and other 
'dirty' samples that may have inhibitors. So research this, & if possible, ask supplier for a free sample of 
mastermix and test it with your sample type before buying tons of it.


2) Do an ihibition test. 
Should be done as standard, especially when dealing with DNA / RNA from environmental samples. 
In this qPCR folder see 'Inhibition Test' document (from Lasse Riemannâ€™s lab) for more details

3) Run a gel

After your qPCR run has finished, don't throw away the plate! (unless the run was a failure and you wont be using the data!)
You should run some of your samples on an agarose gel (2%) to double check that the product is the right size etc.
