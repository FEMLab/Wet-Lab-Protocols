# interpreting standard curve

Plot Ct (y axis) gainst log copy number (x axis)
and perform linear regression & get R2 and equation of the line. 

Equation of the line should be in the form:
y = mx + b

where y= Ct value
m = slope (ideal = 3.32 = 100% efficient)
x = log10 template amount
b = y intercept 
Y intercept is an Indication of sensitivity of assay & how accurately the template has been quantified 

intercept of 33 - 37 is 'perfect' intercept of > 37 either due to 
1) poor efficiency ( slope will also be too big)                                                                       
OR 2) inaccurate template quantif or degraded template 


R2 value - this is a measure of the accuracy of dilutions and pipetting & as usual should be as near 1 as possible
