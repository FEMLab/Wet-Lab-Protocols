pH meter FA lab (Hanna HI 2200)

1. Remove protective cap from electrode
2. Wash electrode with squeeze bottle containing dH2O -> into beaker.
3. Dry electrode with tissue to remove residual water
4. Place electrode in pH 7.01 buffer and press CAL
5. Wait until screen says ‘READY’
6. Press CFM
7. Remove electrode, rinse again in dH2O and dry
8. Place in pH 4.01 buffer and again wait til screen displays ‘READY’
9. Press CFM
10. Remove electrode, rinse and dry
11. Now place in sample and wait for reading to stabilise.
12. Adjust pH with HCl or NaOH as appropriate.

Notes:
 For certain things, eg EDTA, place media on stirred with flea and keep stirring. Then add
electrode but take care not to hit with flea.
 Sample should be at room temp as this affects pH reading – if not at room temp, eg just
taken from fridge, can either wait til it warms or use temperature probe.
