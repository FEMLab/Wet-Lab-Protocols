Potential Denitrification Assay

ie rate of converting nitrates to N2O (when N2O -> N2 blocked)
To check before starting:
- pH of your soil
- availability of acetylene gas -> ususally in small canister in gas cupboards outside. Check with Maurice.
- Place ~ 1L of acetylene in a gas bag and keep gas bag in fume hood when not in use
- Get vials for for storing gas prior to GC analysis (typically 7 ml vials from labco with double septum.)
- Find you where you will send gas samples for GC analysis. 

Stock solutions
•	0.2 M KH2PO4 stock solution: 2.722 g KH2PO4 in 100 mL H2O. 
•	0.2 M K2HPO4 stock solution: 3.843 g K2HPO4 in 100 mL H2O. 
•	1M KNO3
•	0.1M glucose
•	0.1M succinate

Denitrifying buffer solution:

Dibasic and monobasic will be mixed to give buffer of same pH as soil (in this case soil has pH6): 

•	Prepare final buffer to give 2 mM potassium buffer at pH 6 (13.2% dibasic and 86.8% monobasic) 
-> make 10 ml of this and add to 990 ml of dH2O to give 2mM 
•	Final concentration of KNO3 & sugars should be 10mM:
•	For 200ml buffer, 
o	add 2ml of stock KNO3 
o	add 10 ml of glucose stock
o	add 10 ml of succinate stock (combined this gives 10mM carbon source concentration)
o	top up to 200 ml with the PO4 buffer
•	Buffer solution should be stored 4 °C for a maximum of one week, best if used right away.

Method
1.	Weight 20g (fresh weight) soil into 125ml anaerobic vial.  
2.	Add 20ml of buffer solution (if soil is very damp, place in funnel and use buffer to turn it into a 'slurry'
which will then fall more easily into vial. 
3.	Seal flasks with rubber bung and flush with anaerobic gas (I used H2/CO2 mix) for ~2 mins
(use a smaller gauge needle to insert air and a larger gauge needle to allow air out of vial in order to reduce
risk of dangerously over-pressurising vial.
4.	After ~ 2 mins remove both input & output syring at once, then allow excess pressure to escape by inserting 
an empty 50ml syringe (type with rubber seal) & allowing vial air pressure to return to atmospheric.
5.	Insert 12 ml of acetylene gas (equivalent to 10% headspace) from gas bag. Start timer when acetylene added.  
6.	Shake flasks gently on a shaker (90rpm) for 1.5 hours at 15 degrees C.
7.	Take a 12 mL (for 7ml vial) headspace samples at 30, 60 & 90 mins. Keep flasks on shaker between sampling periods.
8.	Make sure to keep a sample of soil for dry weight in order to convert results back to per gram dry weight

* it's best to prelabel all your vials - keep an excel sheet where you put what sample is in each vial number
** if you are storing your vials for any period of time (more than a month say) then you should take a couple of 'stanards'
on each of the days you take gas samples. These 'standards' will be 12 ml of a known gas (eg N2/CO2) mix. You can therefore get an idea
of any leakage with time and potentially adjust for this.
