Measurement of NH4+, NO2- and NO3- (from Bollman et al., 2011)

For all absorbance readings, the plate reading in Dr Maria Tuohey's lab (Biochemistry) was used. 
Check beforehand with Dr Tuohey & remember to sign log in book each time you use machine.

Standards: good for ~ 1 month
Reagents for NH4 quantification: always fresh (no more than two days)
Reagents for NO2 and NO3 quantification: last for months

* Remove stored reagents from fridge ~2 hours before assay to equilibrate to room temperature *   

2.	Preparation of soil sample
Reagent: 2M KCl

a.	On sample day, weigh out between 5 and 25 g fw of soil (depending how much sample available)
b.	Mix soil 1:2 with  2M KCl (ie 10g soil with 20ml solution) -> stir well
c.	Place on shaker in 15°C room for 1 hour
d.	Pour through Whatman filter paper no 1 and collect liquid
e.	If samples can’t be processed that day, aliquot out liquid and place at - 20 °C until process date
f.  Remember to dry aliqout of soil at 110C in order to work back to /g dry weight of soil. 


3.	NH4+ determination (Kandeler and Gerber, 1988)

Reagents

•	12 g/l sodium hydroxide
•	Sodium nitroprusside solution: 85 g/l sodium salicylate and 0.6 g/l sodium nitroprusside
•	0.2 g/l sodium dichloroisocyanurate
•	10 mM NH4 calibration solution: 0.6607 g/l (NH4)2SO4
•	Store all solutions at 4°C.
•	Dilute the calibration solution to 200 µM NH4 in a volumetric flask.
•	Dilute the calibration solution further to 10, 20, 50, 100, and 200 µM NH4 

Two different approaches can be used to determine the NH4 concentration: 
48-well plates and test tubes. The major difference is that the reagents in the test tubes can 
be mixed immediately after addition of the different solutions, which makes the NH4 determination 
more exact and reproducible. * In FEM lab we typically use 48 well plate as have many samples
to analyse.

Determination of the NH4 concentration using the plate-reader & 48 well plates

1.	Prepare dilution range of standard
2.	Use of 48-well plates/test tubes to determine the NH4 concentration.
3.	Add 0.5 ml/2 ml of sample or calibration solution, include blank (water).
4.	Mix sodium hydroxide and sodium nitroprusside solution in the ratio 2:1 (prepare only the amount required for the determination -> 20ml:10ml in falcon & wait few mins until very yellow).
5.	Add 250 µl/1 ml of the mixture to each sample and shake the plate/vortex the test tube immediately.
6.	Add 100 µl/0.4 ml of the sodium dichloroisocyanurate solution to each sample and shake the plate/vortex the test tube immediately.
7.	Incubate in the dark for 30 min. (max 1 hour) -> now prepare nitrate plates
8.	Measure the absorbance in the plate-reader at 660 nm/in the spectrophotometer at 660 nm against water.

Calculation of the NH4 concentration [mM]
•	Subtract the absorbance of the blank (dH2O) from all absorbance values
•	Plot a calibration curve and calculate the slope and Y-intercept
•	Calculate ammonium concentration by [S] ¼ ((Absorbance _ blank)
•	Y-intercept)/slope.
•	If the sample has been diluted, multiply by the dilution factor.
In samples with very low NH4 concentration, NH4 can be determined with the fluorometric method by 
Keroul and Aminot (1997) and Holmes et al. (1999).

4.	NO2 plus NO3 determination (Shand et al., 2008)

Reagents & preparation
•	Catalyst: 35.4 mg/l CuSO4•5H2O and 900 mg/l ZnSO4•H2O
•	40 g/l NaOH
•	1.71 g/l hydrazine sulfate
•	Sulfanilamide solution in HCl: prepare 3.5 M HCl and dissolve 10 g/l sulfanilamide (it might be necessary to 
warm this solution slightly to dissolve the sulfanilamide). IE add 29 ml of 37% HCl to 71 ml Mq H2O (remember AlWays add Acid to Water!! not
other way round!!) -> this will be warm so if you add sulfanilamide quickly, it'll be warm enough to dissolve it without
additional heating. 
•	1 g/l naphthylethylene diamine dichloride (light sensitive, store in amber/foil covered bottle)
•	10 mM NO3 calibration solution: 1.011 g/l KNO3 or 0.8499 g/l NaNO3
•	Store all solutions at 4C.
•	Dilute the calibration solution to 100 µM NO3 in a volumetric flask.
•	Dilute the calibration solution further to 25, 50, 75, and 100 µM NO3
