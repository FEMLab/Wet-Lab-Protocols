Potential Nitrification Assay

ie rate of converting NH4 to NO2 (when NO2 -> NO3 is blocked)

Stock Solutions

•	0.2 M KH2PO4 stock solution: 2.722 g KH2PO4 in 100 mL H2O. 
•	0.2 M K2HPO4 stock solution: 3.843 g K2HPO4 in 100 mL H2O. 
•	10 mM (NH4)2SO4 solution (same soln as used in available N assays) 
•	0.5 M sodium chlorate (NaClO3): 5.3g in 100 ml dH2O
•	2M KCl

Final PN buffer preparation:

Dibasic and monobasic will be mixed to give buffer of same pH as soil (in this case pH6): 

(see ‘ph table kpo4’ in ‘Buffers & Media’ folder for what ratio to use for your soil pH)

•	Prepare final buffer to give 2 mM potassium buffer at pH 6 (13.2% dibasic and 86.8% monobasic) 
-> make 10 ml of this and add to 990 ml of dH2O to give 1L of 2mM buffer
•	Add 5 ml of 0.5 M NaCO3 stock to this 1L to give a final concentration of 2.5 mM 
•	Add 10 ml of (NH4)2SO4 stock to give final concentration of 100 µM

Protocol:
1.	Mix 10g soil (fresh weight) with 100 ml of PN buffer (freshly prepared) in a 250 ml conical flask
2.	Stopper with sponge and put shaking (90 rpm) at 15°C 
3.	For each sample do this x 2 -> one will be left for 24 hours and the other will be To (ie giving background NO2)
4.	For To sample, immediately add 30 ml of 2M KCl and shake for 1 hour
5.	After one hour, filter supernatant through whatman no1 paper -> store in fridge
6.	After 24 hours, stop reaction with 30 ml of 2M KCl and shake for 1 hour
7.	Filter as for T0 samples 
8.	Now measure NO2 concentration as per normal available N assay (protocol for this is in ‘Soil Work’ folder)

Sample storage: once extracted with KCl & filtered, can be stored in fridge for max 24 hours. 
If NO2 can’t be measured within 24 hours, then samples can be stored at -20°C. 
Ideally though, should analyse within 24 hours and not freeze.
