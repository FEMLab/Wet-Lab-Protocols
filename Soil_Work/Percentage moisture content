Percentage moisture content

Use fine balance for all weight measurements. 

- use aluminium weigh boats -> label, weigh and record

- place fresh sample in weigh boat, weigh and record
- put in 110C oven (in pilot lab) for 12 hours. 

- take out of oven and weight immediately. If you have lots of samples then put in desicator while you measure others

% dry weight = (dry weight of soil/fresh weight of soil) x 100

% moisture content = 100 - % dw
